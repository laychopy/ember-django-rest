**This project is currently broken as I'm upgrading it to RC1**

I built this ember.js app to show how you would use a custom mixin for

pagination
filtering
sorting

When this app is working (if you reset HEAD a few times it was working...)

To run this django application

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python manage.py syncdb --noinput
3. python manage.py runserver
